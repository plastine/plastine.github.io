<h1 style="color:#4a90e2;">Initial Project: CS-360 Project Three</h1>

**Context:** 

*This application was designed as an inventory app, with the ability to add new items containing their own primary key within an SQL database, along with a seperate user database for logging in. The users can also view the list of items within the inventory, delete, and update said items. Permsissions for SMS are also included.*

  Enhanced Project: Software Design and Engineering
</h1>

**Context:**

This project was initially written in Android Studio as a java application, but I wanted to refactor the application so that it would be compatible with IOS (apple). My reasoning for this is because I have an iphone, not an andorid, and I felt like it would be itneresting to develop an application for the device that I have grown so reliant on. I decided on doing a native rerwrite using the progamming language Dart. Instead of using andorid studio, I rewrote this application on Flutter, which is the development kit that utilized Dart. This process forced me to become familar with the concept of widgets to build out the user interface. Most of the underlying logic remained the same, however the way in which the application was built totally differed.

**Course Outcome Accomplished:** 

*Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science*


**Justification:**

This application was built using an open source software development kit to create a cross platfrom application. This enables diverse audiences as it breaks the exclusivity behind the initial application to begin with.
