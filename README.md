Andrew Allen's CS-499 Capstone Project

https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/license/

This is a githup pages eportfolio that utilizes minimal mistakes, a jeykll theme. I am not the creator of minimal mistakes. Michael rose is the original creator of it, and i attribute the layout and style to him. I only added some html as well as scss. 

There are three folders inside of this project for the three enhancements associated with the class. 

One is for data structures and algorithms, one is for databases, and one was for software design. I have all of the google doc narratives, code reviews, and github repositories hosted on this website.
