I am currently a senior at Southern New Hampshire Univeristy. Aside from my educational background, I enjoy spending time with my loving partner as well as our kiddo.

I am currently a full-time worker at the 7030 Walmart Distribution Center. I manage my shift via dispatch management (coordinating truck departure times and the order they're completed), check first and last productive acts of associates, utilize excel for data tracking and manipulation, and utilize walmart's proprietary software to ensure my shift meets both the worker's expectations as well as the Home office target goals. I track expesnive items like eggs and bananas, doing itemized inventory counts.

 I am also a competitive yugioh player (yummy best deck). Share some 3D prints with me!
